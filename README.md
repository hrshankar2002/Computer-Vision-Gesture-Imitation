# Computer Vision Gesture Imitation
```
Finger Gesture's are projected on to a robotic arm with the application of Deep Learning and Computer Vision Techniques
```
## Description
```
Pre-Trained deep learning model 'Hands' from MediaPipe lies at the heart of the project. Out of the two repo files , 'main.py' handles finger detection while 'controller.py' helps in projection of the model on to 5 servo's corresponding to 5 fingers. Arduino is interfaced with python with the help of pyfirmata pre-written libraries from arduino.
